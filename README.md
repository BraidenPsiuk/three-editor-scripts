# three-editor-scripts
A collection of small, simple scripts for the [Three.js editor](https://threejs.org/editor)

There are two files for each script:
- [script].js: The actual script. You can copy-paste the contents into the Three.js Editor's script editor.
- [script].json: An example scene description file. You can simply drag-and-drop these into the Three.js Editor window, and you'll get a basic example of what the script does.

Check out the list below to see what each script does and what you can attach it to.
